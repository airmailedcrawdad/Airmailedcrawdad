# Joseph Deloza

üî¨ **Researcher & Inventor** working on advanced physics frameworks and defensive publications in  
**Collapse Coordinate System (CCS)** and **Probability Origin Formalism (POF).**

## üõ∞ Defensive Publications
To ensure openness and prevent privatization, I maintain repositories documenting  
**defensive prior art** in next-generation physics and propulsion:

- [collapse-lattice-defense](https://github.com/airmailedcrawdad/collapse-lattice-defense)  
  *Disclosures on collapse-lattice processors and warp-bubble analog systems.*  

- [emdrive-defense](https://github.com/airmailedcrawdad/emdrive-defense)  
  *Disclosures on EM Drive cavity propulsion, reframed under CCS/POF,  
  including nested cavity geometries, invariant anchoring, Floquet-driven modulation,  
  and thrust enhancement methods.*

## üåê Purpose
These repositories exist as **public defensive disclosures**:  
- To keep advanced physics concepts in the scientific commons.  
- To block privatization attempts via patents.  
- To document practical experimental pathways for low-cost proof-of-concept hardware.
